<h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
Bubble sort is considered the simplest sorting algorithm. It goes through an entire array and compares each neighboring number. It then swaps the numbers and keeps doing this until the list is in ascending order. Bubble sort is time consuming but doesnâ€™t consume a lot of resources (low space complexity).
